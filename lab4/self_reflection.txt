All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I'm not a Berkeley student so I don't have a chance to meet the TAs lol.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Nothing.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Maybe recursive version?

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I don't have a partner.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Learning more about recursion.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Recursive version of get method.
